# **ZORK AND DRAGONS**

Zork and dragons is a text based adventure RPG game which literally wears its two biggest influences on its sleeves. Those being [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) a text based adventure game from the late 70s and the table top game dungeons & dragons.

Made up of two main areas of gameplay. A choose your next step question based system for progression and a turn based battle system. Trying to emulate some of my own favorite games I have tried to incorporate decisions that can lead to avoidance of combat while still advancing.
